<p>Hello, Iâ€™m an aspiring web developer and a proud Computer Science and Engineering graduate. 
  I have taken up a course in Udemy for learning Web development. 
  While I love spending time writing code and designing sleek web pages with HTML and CSS, my journey goes beyond the screen.
</p>

<p>I had gotten my hands dirty working on reducing beach waste! I spent months visiting sites, talking to locals, and brainstorming ways to solve real-world problems. 
    It was a fulfilling experience that taught me the value of on-the-ground efforts and teamwork.
    I also had the opportunity to collaborate with with people of my locality in working to uplift neighboring villages.
</p>

<p>But itâ€™s not all about coding and social workâ€”I've also had my share of hackathon thrills! Public speaking is another passion of mine. 
  Iâ€™ve enjoyed debating, presenting technical solutions, and conducting seminars, which has sharpened my ability to communicate effectivelyâ€”a skill I hold dear whether Iâ€™m on stage or collaborating in teams.
  Outside of work and academic life, Iâ€™m all about reading, drawing, and trying my hand at cooking. Oh, and Iâ€™m learning Frenchâ€”so, bonjour! ðŸ˜Š
