<h3>Taare Zameen Par (2007) </h3>
<p>Taare Zameen is an inspirational and heart-rending movie about Ishaan Awasti, an eight-year-old dyslexic who is considered unruly by his family. 
   He is sent to a boarding school where he meets an art teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumph, 
   who helps him discover his talents while helping his parents see the world through his eyes. </p>

<h3>Interstellar (2014) </h3>
<p>An extraordinary sci-fi movie that blew my mind. 
   With the Earth becoming uninhabitable, Joseph Copper, a farmer and an ex-NASA pilot sets off on a mission to find a new planet for humans. 
   Despite facing the loss of his loved ones, and watching time slip away in their dystopian world, he is determined to find hope for mankind. 
   The visuals are nothing short of spectacular. 
   A must-watch for science enthusiasts. </p>
 
<h3>The Fault in Our Stars (2014)</h3>
<p>This movie deserves to be on the list because it was adapted from one of my favorite young-adult novels, The Fault In Our Stars by John Green.
   It is a heart-wrenching story about two cancer-stricken teenagers and their, unfortunately, short journey of healing each other.   </p>
